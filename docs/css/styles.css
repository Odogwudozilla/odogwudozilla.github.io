/* Modern Portfolio CSS - Modular System Reference */

/*
 * This file serves as a reference for the modular CSS architecture.
 * All styles are now organized in focused, maintainable modules:
 *
 * 1. base.css - Global styles, variables, typography, animations
 * 2. navigation.css - Complete sidebar navigation styling
 * 3. sections.css - All content section layouts and components
 * 4. components.css - Reusable UI components (cards, buttons, forms)
 * 5. responsive.css - Mobile, tablet, and print adaptations
 *
 * Each file is loaded directly in the HTML for better browser compatibility
 * and easier maintenance. To edit styles:
 *
 * - Navigation changes: Edit navigation.css
 * - Content sections: Edit sections.css
 * - UI components: Edit components.css
 * - Mobile/responsive: Edit responsive.css
 * - Global variables/typography: Edit base.css
 *
 * See modular-structure-guide.md for complete documentation.
