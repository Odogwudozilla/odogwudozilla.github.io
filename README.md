- **Bundle Optimization**: Sub-250KB initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: WebP formats with responsive sizing
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript

## ü§ù Development Approach

This project is developed using AI-assisted development practices:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Primary development assistant following [coding guidelines](./.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- **Component-First**: Every feature built as reusable, documented components
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive testing strategy with high coverage requirements
- **Performance-Focused**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
